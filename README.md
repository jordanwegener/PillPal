# PillPal - Medications reminder app for CLI

The purpose of this CLI app is to assist those who, like me, have regularly scheduled medications they need to take and, like me, still manage to forget about them every now and then even though it's a daily routine. I would imagine that if you're like me but have a more extensive regimen than a couple of medications this could be even more problematic for you.

This app is designed for people who have this problem but would prefer to use a simple CLI utility to help.
