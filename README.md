# PillPal - Medications reminder app for CLI

The purpose of this CLI app is to assist those who, like me, have regularly scheduled medications they need to take and, like me, still manage to forget about them every now and then even though it's a daily routine. I would imagine that if you're like me but have a more extensive regimen than a couple of medications this could be even more problematic for you.

This app is designed for people who have this problem but would prefer to use a simple CLI utility to help.

## Functionality

PillPal allows you to input your medication names, dosages, how many you have and the times/days you need to take them. This information is stored and can be edited or recalled in a variety of ways. You can ask PillPal to show you your entire weekly schedule or just that of a single day. You can also simply ask what you need to take in the next 3 or 6 hours, in case you need to leave the house and need a reminder of what you need to pack.

## Installation

### Ruby
